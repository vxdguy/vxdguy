- 👋 Hi, I’m @vxdguy, named after Windows 3.11 virtual driver file extensions.
- 🖥️ Programming has been a hobby for 40 years; it's helped with my job, but was never *the* job.
- :godmode: I now have the time to indulge in my hobby and take it to the next level.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git, C#, VS Code, and TDD.  All at the same time.
- 👀 I’m interested in C#, Linux, and cross-platform programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever piques me interest.
- 🗾 Before retiring, I was a Senior Storage Engineer working for an international conglomerate.
- 📧 My email is vxdguy@gmail.com -- I do not "live" off my phone, so email responses may take a day.
