- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @VXDguy, named after Windows 3.11 virtual driver file extensions.

- üñ•Ô∏è Programming has been a hobby for 40 years; it's helped with my job, but was never *the* job.
  - Self-taught:  TRS-80 BASIC, Z80 machine code, LDOS JCL, MASM, DOS batch, Turbo Pascal, Quick Basic, DOS cmd.
  - Self-taught:  Delphi, FreePascal, NASM, Visual BASIC, Linux/GNU, bash, python.
  - Working on: C# (OOP); previous languages were used for structured programming.
  - Working on: msbuild, git, TDD, and other software engineering giblets.

- :godmode: I'm retired so I now have the time to indulge in my hobby and take it to the next level.
  - Learning C# - the language is easy; the hard part is memorizing the CLR.
  - Implementing software engineering:  using git daily, putting TDD into practice.
  - Using VS Code so learning msbuild, vs code tasks, etc., trying to automate as much as possible.
 
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on whatever piques my interest.
  - Right now that's build tools related to C# and VS Code IDE extensions (implies learning Typescript/Javascript/Node/NPM).
  - Future project: C# source code generator extension.
  - Future project: React/Angular web interface for VS Code C# project management.
  - Future project: Cross platform GUI app, right now I'm thinking Desktop Blazor
  - Future project: Monogame cross-platform game, 2D and 3D
